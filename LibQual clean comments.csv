Really my composition one and two classes with Professor Griffin taught me how to fully utilize the library. However for students that did not take composition here at FGCU might not know how to utilize the library like I do. Maybe informative emails or signage would help.
"
19996222,Undergraduate: Fourth year,Environmental Studies,18 - 22,"The students and staff who work at the library desk are very helpful and kind. I frequently come to the desk even just to talk or ask questions because the staff are so welcoming and they know me by name now. I didn’t know about all the resources the library offered until this year. Being able to rent phone chargers, laptop chargers, cameras, study rooms, and even textbooks has saved me many times. My laptop does fast and usually can’t make it through the full day of classes. And textbooks can be super expensive so these have been a huge help to be able to rent. The library database is very versatile and offers many resources for all my classes. I’ve been able to find articles and books for my papers in all disciplines. For example, I found an essay to check out online for my philosophy class. And I love to go through the environmental isle of books upstairs because they have information on everything. I became interested in falconeering which is a specified skill and they even had a book on it. The IT desk has not been very reliable. They rarely are staffed and students don’t know where to get help so they go to the library front desk where students aren’t trained to assist in their technological problems. I had an issue with logging in with duo push and it took IT services three days to figure out my issue. I appreciate the study spaces in the library. The whiteboards, study rooms, and different seating environments, as well as noise levels with each floor make it easy for me to focus and feel comfortable for many hours of studying. The only recommendation I have for that is that there are more spaces for studying. During mornings and afternoons the study rooms are always completely booked out and there isn’t much seating left. You have to get there at the off times to find a good spot, especially if you are coming with a group of people to work on a group project or something. There also should be better WiFi. Everyday that I have come to the library in this week alone, I have had to connect to my iPhone’s hotspot because the school WiFi would not load due to the mass amount of people logging on to use it. Tutoring services is great, I used them for help with chemistry 1 and the students were patient, understanding, and knowledgeable. They offer many times that make it convenient to go around my schedule. I think the library needs better promotion about the services they offer. The only reason I found out about all of this was because I had a class that taught me about library services. I wish I had known sooner than my senior year because it would have saved me a lot of trouble. One time my laptop crashed for a week and I work completely virtual so I was in desperate need of a computer and they rented me out one. The printing services are awesome because I don’t have to worry about having my own printer and the prices are cheap enough to print entire papers or research graphs. Overall, the library is doing a lot of great things but I would advocate for better IT services and more spaces to study with better WiFi. "
19986652,Undergraduate: Third year,Education,18 - 22,"I really appreciate the facilities. I think that the environment is very learning inspiring and I can focus very well in all areas of the library. My favorite space is the downstairs area with all of the cool furniture. I think the theme is also various aesthetic and makes me want to work here in the library. I appreciate the gender neutral bathrooms in the Starbucks. I also appreciate that there is a silent area dedicated to people who work better and that sort of environment. I think the study room situation works really well and how you check them out so that Group can work together. I haven’t run into any issues at the library  Recently. I have utilized resources like expo markers at the front desk, printing, and the computers downstairs. It used to be difficult for me to access books, and physical copy and still is at times. However, I think this is due to lack of materials on the subjects that I was researching, which is music related. I am a music education major. Overall, the library is my favorite place to get work done and I love that it is open until one in the morning. It’s extremely useful for getting caught up late at night. "

As far as the library atmosphere, I often find it hard to find a place to sit in the peak hours from 11-3pm. I usually have to go to the third floor and even then it is hard to find seating. However, my overall experience is satisfactory. Library staff is knowledge and helpful. My recommendation would be to advertise certain resources more, I found that the classroom visits were most effective in learning about services the library offers.

There have been instances of student workers giving the wrong information or having difficulty with a process. I feel like we have gotten away from making sure everyone practiced the drills with a desk supervisor and practiced shelving, reading the labels, etc. by integrating this again, everyone will be able to perform the tasks and be given the same information to pass on to patrons.

Overall, the library has always provided a safe and supportive learning environment. However, I don't think the library is working at its full potential right now. I have noticed from my time here that those at the circulation desk sometimes lack knowledge of the library services like the library's website and how to navigate things like that properly. I think it would bring a positive impact if we could host a workshop or training of some sort on the library technology services for the student workers and maybe even make it available to other students so they can best know how to research and navigate on their own. Some things that could be included could be how to schedule a study room, how to use the library website and navigate the catalog, and you could even include how to use the makerspace. There are so many resources including the librarian chat on the library's website that go unnoticed or unused simply because of the lack of knowledge on what they are or how to use them effectively. I also think the librarians are not as widely known to be ""helpers."" I think promoting the individual help and advice they can provide in their specialized field would get a lot more people to utilize their services. Much how the CAA get emails sent out to campus, maybe LBS could do the same promoting meetings with librarians when it comes to research and data collection. Another cool way to promote could be to get a journalism student to write one of the inSTALLment articles (student produced articles that go in the bathroom stalls) about LBS services because I always read those when in the bathroom. There is great promotion of the CAA and the Lucas Center but I think the promotion of LBS and Makerspace is what is lacking. "

For one, the library has an extremely personable staff who has been very helpful when I need to ask a question about technology, books, and how to find something. The staff always seems willing to help, and take time to make sure you find what you need. 

The organization of the library is excellent. I feel that the library is structured so that students have ample space to work on their assignments either independently or with a group. There  is plenty of space to sit and relax so that you are comfortable when doing work, and there are lots of tables so you can either work with a team or spread out your things when working. This is always nice when there are lots of papers! I particularly enjoy the whiteboards that are easily accessible and in abundance. Furthermore, I like how you can’t rent study rooms, which is also a very easy process to do. 

Speaking of, I feel that finding resources and using the Eagle Search is both easy and convenient. As a user, it is always nice when technology is made easy. Additionally, most of my work for classes require peer reviewed  and scholarly resources. The library makes it really easy to find and Acess these resources. There are plenty of options to choose from, and the library will make sure you get access to free versions of restricted works. Not only does the database have journals, articles, and books, but there are videos and music as well! 

Overall, I feel like there is supple materials offered, and I have never had difficulty needing to go elsewhere to find quality resources. If you can’t find something, the staff is more than willing to help you search. Which is especially nice when you are on a time schedule. 

A random fact I have really enjoyed about the library is that they offer chargers for! The rental process is quick and easy! 
Also, the website is really user friendly. It is easy for new users to navigate and guides you through how to find your materials. One aspect I like is how you can select a specific subject and choose from that collection. Being able to narrow the search is super convenient to students. 

Lastly, the Librate is always clean and neat, which is a testament to how hard the staff and custodial service works to provide a good environment for studying. "
19986505,Undergraduate: Fourth year,Other,18 - 22,"The library as a whole is doing a great job at providing resources for students. I am a current CAA tutor and an Eagle View Orientation team member, so I am very familiar with all of the resources that the library provides. Unfortunately a lot of the students I tutor and other friends of mine are very unaware of all of the different resources that the library provides. A suggestion I would say is to provide more information about the library within orientation somehow for the incoming students. As for the current students, if there was a semester reminder email about the various resources (not just the online ones) it could reinforce the information about the different kinds of things that students can utilize.  The study spaces for students are very elite. I like the different types of desks, chairs, and areas around the library for students to choose from.  I know a lot of students who come to college struggle with finding sources and researching papers. While chatting with a librarian online is convienent, I think students would benefit from a video tutorial on how to use the data base website or even a general overview of where to find resources (online and in-person) on the library website. After a student watches that tutorial, if they have further specific questions, they can get in contact with a librarian. This could help both the student in asking the right questions and the librarian for providing the correct information that the student is needing. As for finding books online via the “Eagle Search”, I personally find it hard to search for books. When I’m looking to read something for leisure but I don’t know an exact book that I want to read, it is hard for me to just browse leisure reading books. I also know a lot of students get confused on which side of the library is the east or west. If there was a way to put signs in front of both entrances to the library for students to better determine what side is which. I feel that this will be a huge help to new, commuter, and current student’s confusion. I appreciate everything the library has provided me, including technology rentals, research help, a job, and great places for meet to study so I can be a successful student at FGCU."

I also enjoy the aspect of getting to move around the library to different study spots so I don’t get bored. For my studying, I usually opt to book a study room for group and solo projects. I enjoy the quiet rooms and the tv where I can project what I am trying to learn. I have also used the library to borrow various materials for my classes, including chargers, calculators and other devices needed. I like how easy it is to check out one of these devices. I can just show up, ask for what I want, give my UIN and just leave. Returning it is even easier, I just hand it to them. These supplies are amazing as a student on a budget, and make it so I don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on supplies I only need for one semester. I also use the library database. It was introduced in my composition 1 Class and has been a great help in writing papers.

I like that they have certain textbooks available to check out, which saves me money, and also fun book displays in Library West that expose me to new books and genres. The integration of the CAA study space in particular is an environment and service that can be very helpful for students who want to learn how to learn on their own in a study space. I do think that many of the library services are unknown by many students, since nowadays it is very easy to google and look up resources rather than look for them in a library. I think more exposure of these resources and highlighting their necessity could help in garnering more students to use these services, because I do think that they are useful and the library staff is very helpful.

The free book carts are always fun and engaging to see, however I do believe they could be promoted better with either a little sign with a weekly theme or a post online (then again, I don't know if there is a library Instagram or not at the moment). The events held sometimes are cute, I would like to see more to promote engaging with reading—it seems like the main event is the blind date with Valentines day and more events like that would be cute, maybe horror showcases around Halloween, something to celebrate the Chinese new year theme might also be cool, but that's just me brainstorming.

"
19987577,Undergraduate: First year,Education,18 - 22,"I have a few concerns I'd like to address about the library. The first is that although the temperature outside is often very warm, usually raging from upper 70-90s  the temperature inside is often much colder and feels between upper 60s to lower 70s, because of this issue, I often find myself bringing a jacket even though Iit is unesscary to wear outside. This can prove a great inconvenience because now I find myself carrying extra weight from class to class.  If there is not an easy way to increase the tempature in the library an additional resource you could implement is by providing blankets that students can grab and use while studying, this could increase the warmth of individual students and would not cause a hefty increase on the AC or heating bill. The implementation of the blankets could also further strengthen a comfy and welcoming environment. By having a welcoming environment it may invite and incentivise more students to use the libraries resources and increase the amount of people studying. Secondly, I feel like there should be a diversity of furniture in the library. Most of the chairs in the library are exactly the same model and can be frustrating if you don't like the desired setup and may prevent students from entering the library. Personally, I don't like the chairs that lean back in the library. When I use those types of chairs I feel that I have a lack of support and whenever I lean back I feel nautious, as a result I have to sit at the very edge of the seat making the set up very uncomfortable and aggregivating as I've often fallen off my chair as a result. Last semester I found myself ignoring the library because my mindset was that the library was a cold and uncomfortable place to study. This assumption led me to miss out on many of the wonderful resources the library offers, such as the tutoring center, study rooms, the writing lab, and the various devices that you can check out. Another thing, I want to note about the various furniture in the library is it's often not ergonomic for long studying sessions. This is because several of the setups involve a chair that's a shorter than the table forcing the student to crouch down or hunch in order to access out computer or other homework. One of the reasons why this is bad is this can create a habit of reinforcing bad posture. The chairs and tables should all be at even height or the table should be taller than the chair, so that it reinforces proper posture such as a straight back. Study rooms are a great resource to have on campus. There is a shortage of these study rooms causing many students to stay awake until midnight to reserve a study room. Additionally, many of these study rooms state that they are filled on the booking site, however these study rooms often sit empty throughout the majority of the day. This is because orginzations or groups can book these rooms in advance and end up not using the rooms. Although I don't have much experience with the booking site, I believe there should be a way to notify the person or orginzation a couple days in advance and give them the option to keep their booking or cancel it so that another person can book that room. This could help so that many of the study rooms don't sit empty and allow for more students to have a chance to use this great resource. Another thing you could do is implement a sign in system. This could inolve the party that wants to use the room to sign in at the library front desk and get a key card to unlock one of the study rooms. This could allow students to be notified if an occupancy opens up and allow students to reserve the room, which could give more students access to this resource. Lastly, I like the system of being able to check out materials such as calculators or chargers this system is very useful but one of the things I've noticed is that although these materials have a time limit on them, there is no way to keep track of that time. You could checkout a phone charger with a limit of 3hrs but than if you don't set a timer for 3hrs there is no way to know how much time has passed and you could keep that charger for several hours. Although this may be beneficial to that specific student it limits the amount of people who can use this charger as severall of the materials may not be returned to the desk for checkout. "

19992411,Undergraduate: First year,Business / Golf / Resort & Hospitality,18 - 22,"The FGCU library is a really good resource. I especially love the cubbies on the second floor that overlook the middle area. I often use the study rooms and appreciate their accessibility. I wish there were more of the booths (individual blue and green ones) on the third and fourth floor. One of my only complaints is that I wish we could rent books for more time, or have a way to renew my rental without going to the front desk. I dont know if it is because you do not want people to take them to classes, but it gets annoying when I am using a book to study and have to go down three floors to have them know I am still using it. I also wish there was the opportunity to have phone chargers with USB plugs so I can charge my phone and my computer in the little booths (that only have one outlet), but with the USBC chargers I cannot. I would also suggest a more in depth, or picture tutorial of how to use the printers because they were quite confusing to get a hang of and I had to have help from multiple peers. My final suggestion would be possibly considering an earlier opening time. I had a 7:30 biology class, and I love to study before class for tests. Since it was an earlier class, I would have to go to the Starbucks off campus to get the study environment that I sought after. I appreciate all the accessibility of chargers, books, and printers that the library offers. It is a very cozy and helpful environment that I enjoy spending my time in and it has definitely been a big factor in me getting all my work done.

19988102,Undergraduate: Fourth year,Communications / Journalism,18 - 22,"The FGCU Library is one of the best spots on campus for students to grow and study as a whole. The staff and students and employees in the library are very respectful, understanding and knowledgeable. The staff know how to help every and any student with any questions regarding the library and the staff know how to make sure students secure whatever type of equipment they are looking for as a whole. 

The library is an ideal place to study, do homework and do so much more in a quiet and more relaxed place on campus. I usually will study or do homework in the library two to three times a week because of how quiet the silent floors are as a whole. 

One overall area of improvement in the library would be the computers. The computers are very outdated and can use some upgrades to newer computers in order to make sure students have access to certain websites, platforms and networks as a whole. Sometimes I have tried to use the computer to access my software engineering homework sites and have had no luck. Having newer or more advanced computers can be super beneficial in order to make sure all students of all majors can have access to the computers as a whole. 

Another  area of improvement in the library would be increasing loan rentals for books. If calculators are a 24 hour rental then book rentals should also be 24 hours in my opinion. I have loaned books from the library and have had to hustle to get my work done due to the short loan rental period for textbooks. Increasing the loan rental period for books and other technologies in order to make sure that all students will have ample amounts of time in order to use these equipments is fair and beneficial to all.

 One final area of improvement would be securing more TI-85 calculators. Having more of these calculators is beneficial to STATS students and students in statistics courses in order to make sure they will be able to have calculators for class and also for exams as well. There were times this year where I would try to rent a calculator and wouldn’t be able to as they were all gone. Having more calculators is super beneficial as a whole. 

Overall the FGCU Library is one of the best spots on campus to get work done and I have no doubt that students will continue to utilize the library and all the resources offered for years to come.

FGCU log-in lets me access the database under the university, which I am assuming is sponsored by the FGCU library.

19988786,Undergraduate: First year,Criminal Justice / Legal Studies / Forensics,18 - 22,"The library has been incredibly helpful when it comes to my academics. Sometimes I can find some of the employees to be blank faced and tired, I also understand that some of them are students and that just as I do, they have classes, midterms and finals. I can’t really blame the employees for being tired and uninterested when they are probably thinking of the three tests they have this week. When it comes to resources, the library has always been helpful with printing, computers, IT or even just a calm place to work. I have to say that I have had trouble with ink in the printers so to have those checked more often would be nice but that’s such a minor issue. When it comes to computers, the library always comes in clutch when I for got mine in my dorm, though the WiFi can be a little slow sometimes. Eve in the study rooms, it can take any of my devices 5 or more minutes to load the screen, not always but enough times to be an issue. Though, except for those few things I haven’t had an issue and the library has been super helpful. It’s especially helpful when I have research projects and essays cause I can go on the library website and see if they have certain films or books that’s I need. It definitely was helpful this semester.

19993881,Undergraduate: Second year,Math / Science / Biotech / Biology / Marine Science / Environmental Science,18 - 22,"The library is truly a haven for productivity and learning! Every time I am there, I'm greeted by a clean environment that's conducive to focus and concentration. The staff members are not only friendly but incredibly helpful; they go above and beyond to ensure that every student and visitor feels supported and valued. One of the things I appreciate most about the library is how well-organized everything is. The resources are neatly arranged and easy to locate, making research and studying a breeze. Whether I'm searching for a specific book or searching the fgcu databases, I can always count on the library to provide reliable resources. I find myself spending countless hours immersed in my work at the library. It's amazing how much I can accomplish in such a welcoming space! Whether I'm tackling assignments, delving into research projects, or simply seeking inspiration, the library never fails to deliver.
 In essence, the library is a hub of knowledge and support where I can thrive academically. I'm incredibly grateful for its existence and the positive impact it has on my academic journey."
19988712,Undergraduate: Fourth year,Education,18 - 22,"The library provides students with a place to complete assignments, homework, study for exams, and work collaboratively with peers. I feel that the space available for students to use for these activities are plentiful and accessible. Working in the library allows many students to be productive outside of their courses. When coming to FGCU I lived on campus for the first 2 years. I found that working in the library made me feel less alone and more comfortable at FGCU. The library also allowed for students to work together on coursework and meet about pending assignments. I found that the employees were helpful and knowledgeable about the resources available in the library as well as some on campus resources. I also enjoyed that the library was open at odd hours as it is accessible for those with busy schedules. A recommendation to create a better experience for everyone would be to add more seating with desk tops for using laptops. Some of the seating is comfortable and homey but hard to use for school work because there is not a desk top to place a laptop on. Another recommendation would be to create google documents for sign ups for the conference room style work spaces in the library building. I found that it was difficult to find a place to work in a group at times. If there was an easily accessible document online, it would have been more convenient to work in groups and find a place to work collaboratively for courses. All in all the library is a great resource for students at FGCU. If some recommendations are taken into account and they begin to implement some improvements I feel that more students would use the library and the resources it provides.

I love the seating options and the study rooms which help me to focus when I really need to. The computer there have helped me out countless time when my computer was being fixed, and I would have failed assignments without them. Also, as an education major, I use the printer weekly to print out worksheets for my student teaching, and the library has been a life saver for me in that regard. The FGCU library is definitely one of the places that I’ll miss most when I graduate!

Also going into the library is the only space where I feel I can focus on doing school work because it is quiet and neat space to work. But I would say the most helpful resource that the library has provided me in providing me with the online textbook for my course RED 4310. Which I am very appreciative of as it has saved me money and it is easy to navigate. Thank you for providing us with these services!

19996131,Undergraduate: Second year,Business / Golf / Resort & Hospitality,18 - 22,"The renovation on the first floor completelty ruined the library. There are no spaces in the entire library now with individual desks and desktop computers, it was perfect before and now its just two rows of computers all lined up next to each other. The desk spaces that were there before with walls between each computer are what made the library worth going to. Hours are also terrible, the fact that the library closes at 6pm some days and is not open 24 hours, especially during finals week, is ridiculous.
